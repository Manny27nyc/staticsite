# staticsite user-relevant changes

# New in version 1.2

* RestructuredText Feature, see <doc/rst.rst>, thanks to @valholl.
* Taxonomies now need to be explicitly listed in settings as a `TAXONOMIES`
  list of taxonomy names. staticsite prints a warning if a `.taxonomy` file is
  found that is not listed in `TAXONOMIES`.
* Try harder to localize timestamps as the configured site TIMEZONE.
* Added a `ssite show` command to open a directory in a browser without loading
  possibly unsafe settings.
* When run without a `settings.py`, take more defaults from repo mode. This
  makes running staticfile or arbitrary directories quite useful, and similar
  to viewing a repository on GitLab/GitHub.
* Improved logging in case of jinja2 errors. Use --debug to see a full
  stacktrace.
* Instantiate Feature classes in dependency order: this allows a feature
  constructor to register hooks with another one.
* Significantly reengineered 'tags' feature.
* `description` can now be used for page metadata.
* `template_title` and `template_description`, if present while `title` and
  `description` are not, are rendered with jinja2. See [doc/metadata.md] for
  details.
* `template` metadata can be used to choose a custom template to render the
  page, similar to [Jekill's layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/).
* Vendorized assets in `theme/static/` are now read by asset library name, as
  if `static/` were the same as `/usr/share/javascript/`. Now you need to refer
  to `/jquery/jquery.min.js` and `/bootstrap4/css/bootstrap.min.css` instead of
  `jquery.min.js` and `css/bootstrap.min.css`.
* Added syndication feature (see <doc/syndication.md>) to simplify generation
  of RSS and Atom feeds
* If a `config` file exists in the theme directory, it is loaded as
  yaml/json/toml (same as a page front matter) and used as theme configuration
* `static_assets` in theme configuration can be used to load assets from
  `/usr/share/javascript`
* A `.staticsite` file in a content directory is read as directory metadata,
  and can be used to provide metadata to `.j2.html` pages. See
  <doc/contents.md> for details.
* Static assets loaded by the theme have been moved to `static/` in the
  rendered site, to avoid cluttering the rest of the contents. Referring to
  them in `url_for` in templates has not changed.
* Added `ssite dump_meta` to page information as available to templates
* One can now match pages by regexp and not just by glob. See
  <doc/page-filter.md>.
* Cleaned up reference documentation.
* Turned `inline_pages.html` template into a `blog.html` macro library for
  blogs and category pages.
* Set `asset` to true for a file in [`.staticsite` directory metadata](doc/contents.md),
  to force loading it as a static asset.
* New setting [`JINJA2_PAGES`](doc/jinja2.md): now `*.html` pages are
  considered jinja2 templates by default.
* Renamed `j2` feature to `jinja2`

## Upgrade notes

### Taxonomies

* if you use taxonomies, explicitly list them in the new `TAXONOMIES`
  setting.
* `item_name` in a `.taxonomy` file does not have a special meaning anymore,
  and templates can still find it in the taxonomy page metadata
* `output_dir` in a `.taxonomy` file is now ignored, and the taxonomy pages
  will be in a directory with the same name as the file, without extension
* `tags.html`, `tag.html`, and `tag-archive.html` templates need updating: see
  the versions in `example/theme` for an updated example

### Settings

* `PROJECT_ROOT` setting now defaults to `None` instea of `.`, and if None will
  be filled using the directory where the settings file is found, or the
  current directory otherwise. The resulting behaviour should be in practice
  very similar to the previous `.` setting.
* `TIMEZONE` setting now defaults to the system or user timezone instead of
  `UTC`
* `CONTENT` setting now defaults to `PROJECT_ROOT` instead of `content`. Set
  it to `content` explicitly if you depend on the previous value
* `OUTPUT` setting now defaults to `None` instead of `web`, and `ssite build`
  will ask you to set it or provide a `--output` option. Set it to `web`
  explictly if you depend on the previous value
* `SITE_NAME` setting now defaults to `None` instead of `Site name not set`,
  and will be filled with the title of the toplevel index page, or the basename
  of the toplevel content directory if the toplevel index page has not title
  set or is autogenerated.

### Command line

* Running `ssite serve` on a random repository cloned off the internet can
  expose you to arbitrary code execution if the project includes a
  `.staticsite.py` settings file: use `ssite show` instead. Use `ssite serve`
  for authoring your own websites, whose settings you control.

### Link stability

* `tag/archive.html` is now `tag/archive`
* Static assets loaded by themes are now moved into a `static/` directory in
  the rendered website. `url_for` generates the right links for them, but if
  one had hardcoded links to them in the site, or external sites linked to the
  site static assets, those links may end up broken

# New in version 1.1

* Documented and consolidated the Features feature
* Reuse existing static content in destination directory to speed up rendering
* Allow to invoke feature-specific code from the command line
  (`ssite site --cmd â€¦`)

# New in version 1.0

* Refactored codebase to introduce the concept of pluggable Features. Most
  staticsite features are now implemented as pluggable features, and new
  features can be provided with python modules placed in the
  `$THEMEDIR/features/` directory
* Implemented data pages, as yaml, toml, or json, that provide pure datasets.
  `data-$type.html` jinja2 templates can be used to render their contents.
* Speed up site rebuilds by caching intermediate markdown contents

**Upgrade notes**:

 * To prevent the creation of a cache directory in your `PROJECT_ROOT`, set the
   new `CACHE_REBUILDS` setting to `False`.

# New in version 0.6

* Allow to filter by taxonomies in `site_pages()`
* New settings `SYSTEM_ASSETS` to list directories in `/usr/share/javascript`
  to include to site assets
* Generate unique IDs in footnotes by default. Thanks DonKult!
* Implement rendering raw JSON, YAML, or TOML data files

# New in version 0.5

* Fixed markdown syntax for link targets in `example/archetypes/links.md`

# New in version 0.4

* Pages with dates in the future are considered drafts not yet to be published.
  Added option --draft to include them in the rendering.
* Added `{{next_month}}` to the template variables.
* Default editor configuration appends a `+` to the command line to open the
  file with the cursor at the end.
* If the archetype does not need a title or a slug, the `-t` argument to `ssite
  serve` is optional and no title will be asked interactively.
* Documented how to use staticsite to blog a monthly collection of links.

# New in version 0.3

* Allow to point to .py configuration instead of project on command line.
  This means you can potentially have a farm of .py site descriptions pointing
  at various other directories in the file system.
* archetypes and output directory configurable in `settings.py`. See
  [settings.md](doc/settings.md) for details.
* Added `--theme`, `--content`, `--archetypes` and `--output` to command line
  to override the corresponding settings.
* Fixed a bug in taxonomy generation

# New in version 0.2

* Configurable site layout, using `CONTENT` and `THEME` in `settings.py`. See
  [the settings reference](doc/settings.md) for details.
* The example `settings.py` has been updated to use `content` for site
  contents, like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) does.
* Directory indices: if in your contents you have `dir/foo.md` without
  `dir/index.md` or `dir/index.j2.html", then a directory index for dir will be
  generated automatically, showing links to all site pages in that directory.
* Documentation has been expanded and split into separate files under `doc/`
* New template function `taxonomies()` that returns a list of taxonomies. See
  [templates.md](doc/templates.md).
* New template filter `|basename` that returns the basename of a path. See
  [templates.md](doc/templates.md).
