# site: contents of the site

staticsite does not mandate a site structure, and simply generates output based
on where input files are found inside `content` or any other directory you
configure in [settings.py](settings.md).

You can organise pages in directories in any way you want, and the structure of
the static site that will be generated will mirror the structure of pages in
`content`.

`content` can contain:

* [markdown files](markdown.md), with extension `.md`. `dir/file.md` will
  become `dir/file.html` in `web`.
* [jinja2 templates](templates.md) for arbitrary content, which contain `.j2`
  in their file name. `dir/file.j2.html` will become `dir/file.html` in `web`.
* [taxonomy files](taxonomies.md), with extension `.taxonomy`. Each taxonomy
  file represents one way to categorise your pages. `dir/tags.taxonomy` will
  become `dir/tags/â€¦` in `web`, filled with an index for the whole taxonomy,
  one page per element in the taxonomy, rss and atom feeds, and archive pages.
* any other file will be copied as-is to `web`. `dir/file.jpg` will be
  copied as `dir/file.jpg` in `web`.

## Directory metadata

If a `.staticsite` file is found in a content directory, it is parsed as
`yaml`, `json`, or `toml`, and its contents are available to staticsite
features.

Entries currently supported:

* `files`: provides extra metadata for files found in the directory. This can
  be used, for example, to provide metadata for `.j2.html` pages.

Example directory metadata:

```yaml
---
files:
  index.j2.html:
    syndication:
      filter:
        path: blog/*
        limit: 10
        sort: "-date"
      add_to:
        path: blog/*
      title: "Example blog feed"
```
