# Add an image for a post

If your post is called `post.md`, add an image with the same name, like
`post.jpg` or `post.png`, and the image will appear in the post.

If the image has an [`ImageDescription` EXIF tag](../reference/images.md), the
theme may use it as an `alt` text and as an image caption.

You can run `ssite meta post.jpg` to edit the image metadata that staticsite
can use.
