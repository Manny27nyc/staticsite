# This and the following posts are examples of how to build an interlinked
# series of posts.

# The title of the first post by default sets the title for the whole series

# You set the post date to be a dayinto the future, and it will be ignored
# until that date. You can use this to have the series post itself at regular
# intervals, provided you get the site to rebuild itself regularly.
date = "2016-03-01 00:00:00+01:00"

# Name of the series. All pages with the same series name will be part of this
# series, ordered by date.
series = "exampleseries"

# Also use a tag to automatically get an index for the series
tags = [ "exampleseries" ]
